## Hi there, I’m Ragha and welcome to my portfolio 👋

Analytics Engineer / Data Analyst with a strong focus on SQL-first, production-style analytics pipelines using both ETL and ELT approaches, depending on system constraints. I design database-centric analytics systems that turn raw data into trusted, decision-ready insights across cloud data warehouse and BI tools.

- Python (EDA, data cleaning, batch processing, reusable modules)
- Analytics engineering (Snowflake, PostgreSQL, SQL views, and materialized views)
- dbt modeling (staging → intermediate → marts, incremental models, tests, lineage)
- BI dashboards built on strong semantic layers (Power BI, DAX, and DirectQuery)
- End-to-end ownership: ingestion → modeling → analytics → dashboards
- Git (documentation and version control)

## How I work

- Prefer database-first transformations, choosing ETL or ELT based on data volume, performance, and system constraints. 
- Treat analytics like software: versioning, testing, and documentation.  
- Optimize for clarity, performance, and stakeholder trust  
- Build systems that are explainable, maintainable and scalable.
- Prefer database first transformations across on prem and cloud warehouses.

## Featured Projects

### 🛒 Retail Analytics Engineering Pipeline (Instacart)
Demonstrates a database-first analytics architecture optimized for performance and scale.
PostgreSQL-centric analytics warehouse (3M+ rows) with SQL semantic layer and Power BI (DirectQuery).

#### Techstack: Python · PostgreSQL · Power BI 

- Business KPIs implemented directly in SQL
- Heavy use of views & materialized views for performance
- BI dashboards implemented using DirectQuery for   
- dbt added as a documentation & modeling layer

### 🚀 Incrementality Lab – Growth Experimentation

Simulates how a product or growth team evaluates whether an A/B test should be rolled out.

Built a structured experimentation workflow with validity checks, guardrails, and practical impact thresholds to support real deployment decisions.

#### Techstack: Snowflake · dbt · Snowpark Python · Power BI

* Modeled experiment population and KPIs in dbt
* Implemented rollout decision logic with confidence thresholds
* Added guardrail protection for engagement metrics
* Built a two-page dashboard for decision and segment analysis

### 📊 Rossmann Analytics Engineering (dbt)
Simulates a production-grade analytics workflow with clear separation of ingestion, modeling, and BI.

#### Techstack: Python · dbt · PostgreSQL · Power BI.

- Deterministic data cleaning and ETL in Python  
- dbt modeling with tests, lineage, and marts  
- BI dashboards built directly on dbt marts

### ❄️ Marketing Analytics Engineering Pipeline 
End-to-end, cloud-native marketing analytics pipeline focused on incremental processing, clean modeling, and attribution-aware analysis.

#### Tech: Python · Snowflake · dbt · Power BI

- Single raw attribution dataset ingested incrementally into Snowflake (ELT)
- Python used for EDA, sanity checks, and batch preparation (no business logic)
- dbt models produce BI-ready daily marts (campaign and overall performance)
- Incremental correctness validated via SQL tests (no duplicates, append behavior)
- Power BI dashboard built directly on dbt marts with a thin semantic layer
