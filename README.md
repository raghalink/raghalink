## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Ragha 👋  
Analytics Engineer / Data Analyst focused on SQL-first, production-style analytics pipelines.
I design analytics systems that turn raw data into decision-ready insights.

- first analytics engineering (PostgreSQL, views, materialized views)
- dbt modeling (staging → intermediate → marts, tests, lineage)
- BI dashboards built on strong semantic models (Power BI, DAX, DirectQuery)
- End-to-end ownership: ingestion → modeling → analytics → dashboards

## How I work

- Prefer database-first transformations over BI-layer logic  
- Treat analytics like software: versioning, testing, documentation  
- Optimize for clarity, performance, and stakeholder trust  
- Build systems that are explainable, not just impressive
